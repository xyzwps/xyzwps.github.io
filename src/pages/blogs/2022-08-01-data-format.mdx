  of the limitations of JSON by expanding its syntax to include some productions
  from ECMAScript 5.1.

  for JVM languages using HOCON files.
- [RON](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron) is a simple readable data serialization
  format that looks similar to Rust syntax. It's designed to support all of
  [Serde's data model](https://serde.rs/data-model.html), so structs, enums,
  tuples, arrays, generic maps, and primitive values.
- [YAML](https://yaml.org/) is a human-friendly data serialization language for
  all programming languages.
- [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) is a data serialization system.
